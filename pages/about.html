<p> Game Gardens was created by the scurvy developers at Three Rings
Design to foster experimentation in online game development. We'll have a
more substantial manifesto here at some point but for now take a look
around and post to the forums or email
<a href="mailto:gardens@threerings.net">gardens@threerings.net</a> if you
have questions.
