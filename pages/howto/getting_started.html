<p><b>Building and Playing the Sample Games</b><br>
You should have the sample games downloaded and unpacked. If you haven't
done that yet, you can download the necessaries from <a href="/howto/">the
main tutorial page</a>. This will be a directory tree looking something
like the following:

<pre class="example">
games/bin - various scripts
games/lib - various jar files
games/atlantis - one of the sample games
games/skirmish - another of the sample games
</pre>

<p> You will need <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> installed to
build the sample games and, of course,
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> as well. Note that JDK 1.5 is
required to build and run the games.

<p> From here, there are two sets of instructions on compiling and running
the sample games:

<ul>
<li> <a href="#unix">Unix (Linux, MacOS X, etc.)</a>
<li> <a href="#windows">Windows</a>
</ul>

<p><b><a name="unix">Getting Started on Unix (Linux, MacOS X, etc.)</a></b><br>

<p> Change into the <code>atlantis</code> directory and build the game:

<pre class="example">
cd games/atlantis
ant dist
</pre>

<p> Now change back into the top-level <code>games</code> directory and
run the server:

<pre class="example">
cd ..
./bin/toyserver atlantis
</pre>

<p> In another terminal window, run a client as username
<code>laurel</code> (or pick any username you like, it doesn't matter):

<pre class="example">
./bin/toyclient laurel
</pre>

<p> And in yet another terminal window, run a second client:

<pre class="example">
./bin/toyclient hardy
</pre>

<p> You should now be logged into your own multiplayer game server with
two clients and you can create a table and play a fine game of Atlantis
against yourself.

<p> You can compile the <code>skirmish</code> sample game in the same way
and run the server with that game to try it out. Simple replace
<code>atlantis</code> on the command line with <code>skirmish</code> when
running the server and the run the clients.

<p><b><a name="windows">Getting Started on Windows</a></b><br>

<p> Malachid was kind enough to provide some info on getting things up
and running under Windows which you can
<a href="/discussion/mvnforum/viewthread?thread=2">read here</a>.
